""" SLOTTED VIVALDI ANTENNA

In this demo we will look at the design of a slotted Vivaldi antenna in EMerge and how it can be setup.

The antenna is not perfect. The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate how parametric curves are implemented in EMerge.
Additionally, the narrow regions are a perfect opportunity to demonstrate the efficiency of adaptive mesh refinement.

Due to the wind band nature of this simulation, it might take a while to simulate. 

For ARM MacOS users it is reccommended to install UMFPACK and run this using multi-processing.

# Vivaldi curve parametric equations fy(t) and fx(t)
# t ∈ [0, 1]
# fx(t) = L*t
# fy(t) = (g/2) Kᵗ + (W-gK)/(2-2K) (1 - Kᵗ)

fx = lambda t: t*L
fy = lambda t: (g/2)*K**t + (W-g*K)/(2-2*K) *(1-K**t)

# We will create the slots around the vivaldi by making slots that stretch across the entire
# PCB and then removing the exponential taper region dilated by some 5 millimeters.
# We could use a curve dilation but in this case we will derive the analytical expresion ourselves!

# This A-coeff is just to make the equations more brief.
A = (g/2) - (W-g*K)/(2-2*K)

# We need to find the derivative of dfy(t)/dfx
dfx = lambda t: A*np.log(K)/L * K**(t)

# To create the dilated curve we have to formulate the parametric equation of a unit length tangent vector
# We know that the ratio of ty/tx is equal to the derivative of the curve so we can normalize the length
# by defining R(t) as
R = lambda t: 1/np.sqrt(1 + dfx(t)**2)
# Such that 
# t = R [f'(x), 1]

# Then the normal vector is simply
# n = R [1, -f'(x)]

# We add this scaled by the margin to our parametric equation to get:
fx2 = lambda t: t*L - slot_margin*R(t)*dfx(t)
fy2 = lambda t: fy(t) + slot_margin*R(t)

# Now that we have our parametric equations defined we first make an airbox and set its material priority to a low value.
# This makes sure that in overlapping regions, the air material will not be assigned. In this example it likely isn't necessary but it is good practice.

# We make our tapered region as following

# Step 1: We create an XYPolygon that is empty
# Step 2: We draw our first taper for the top curve. That is simply our parametric line
# Step 3: We make the return path being the bottom. This includes the same X-values and the Y-values inverted (-Y). And we must reverse the points from end to start.
# Step 4: Finally we turn our XYPolygon into a geometry by embedding it in a Coordinate System that is at the z-coordinate of the bottom of our PCB (-th).
